use calculated field to create a link
="<a href='"&%URL_Field_Name%&"'> "&[%field_name%]&"</a>"

In Excel you will need columns:

Desc = hyperlink text
URL = URL link
HTML = formula to create an HTML hyperlink anchor
A	B	C
1	Desc	URL	HTML
2	MyLink	https://link.to/blah	=concatenate("<a href=""",A2,""">",B2,"")
In your SharePoint List, you will need a column set as:

Multiple lines of text
Use enhanced rich text (Rich text with pictures, tables, and hyperlinks)
You can then copy/paste from Excel the HTML column into your SharePoint list column while in grid view (allowing adding dozens of rows at a time).
