To freeze the header of a modern SharePoint list, you can follow these steps:

Open the SharePoint list in which you want to freeze the header.

Click on the "Edit" button at the top right corner of the list.

Select the "Column options" dropdown menu from the toolbar.

Choose "Freeze header" from the options.

Once you click on "Freeze header", the header row will become static and stay visible even when you scroll down the list.

Note: If you want to unfreeze the header, you can simply click on "Column options" and select "Unfreeze header" from the dropdown menu.
